/**
 * In Intro2 we learnt how to allocate an off-heap memory buffer using MemoryUtil. This was done by first calling one of
 * the memAlloc*() methods which return a Java NIO Buffer instance representing the allocated memory region. Once we
 * were done with the buffer, we called the memFree() method to deallocate/free the off-heap memory represented by the
 * Java NIO Buffer.
 * <p>
 * This manual memory management is necessary when a buffer needs to live for an extended amount of time in our
 * application, meaning that the time between allocation and deallocation spans beyond one method.
 * <p>
 * In most scenarios however, the memory will be very short-living. One example was the allocation of the memory to fill
 * the VBO in Intro2. Memory was allocated, filled with data, given to OpenGL and then freed again.
 * <p>
 * LWJGL 3 provides a better way to handle such situations, which is by using the MemoryStack class. This class allows
 * to retrieve a small chunk of memory from a pre-allocated thread-local memory region of a fixed size. By default the
 * maximum size allocatable from the MemoryStack is 8 kilobytes.
 * <p>
 * By the way: It is called a stack because allocations/deallocations must be issued in LIFO order, in that allocations
 * cannot be freed randomly bust must be freed in the reverse allocation order. This allows to avoid any heap allocation
 * and compaction strategies.
 * <p>
 * Also note that the pre-allocated memory of the MemoryStack is per thread. That means, every thread will get its own
 * memory region and MemoryStack instances should not be shared among different threads.
