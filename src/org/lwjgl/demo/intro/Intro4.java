/**
 * In Intro3 we learnt how to allocate short-lived memory using the MemoryStack class.
 * <p>
 * There was one thing missing, though, which is necessary when working with manual memory management, including the
 * MemoryStack, which is: Ensuring that the stackPop() call happens eventually. This may not be the case when the code
 * between stackPush() and stackPop() throws an exception.
 * <p>
 * To take care of possible exceptions, we will therefore wrap the code in a try-with-resources statement to ensure that
 * stackPop() will get called eventually.

         * Wrap the code that is using the MemoryStack in a Java 7 try-with-resources statement. The nice thing here is
         * that the MemoryStack class itself implements AutoCloseable, so it is applicable to being the resource in the
         * try-with-resources statement.
         *
         * What is also new here is that a call to stackPush() actually returns something, namely an instance of the
         * MemoryStack class. This instance represents the thread-local MemoryStack instance, which would otherwise be
         * accessed whenever we call stackPush(), stackPop() or one of the static stackMalloc* methods.
         *
         * So, the code below calls the static method stackPush() on the class MemoryStack, which returns the
         * MemoryStack instance of the current thread. At the end of the try-with-resources statement, a call to
         * MemoryStack.pop() will be done automatically to undo the allocation.
